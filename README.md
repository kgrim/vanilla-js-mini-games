# Mini Game Template

A Vanilla Javascript template using Functional programming methods. This template has been used as a base for numerous minigames that accept dynamic assets. 

For efficiency, I have built this template to help me create mini-games such as the examples found in the [`js-only-examples`](https://github.com/kgrim/vanilla-js-mini-games/tree/main/js-only-examples) folder. The information about the games can be seen in the [`README`](https://github.com/kgrim/vanilla-js-mini-games/tree/main/js-only-examples/README.md) of the examples folder.
